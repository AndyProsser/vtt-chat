## 1) Executive Status

Current overall status: **Stages 0-5 complete, Stage 6 in progress (core backend + frontend sync implemented), Stage 8 partially complete, Stage 7 scaffolded**.

- Contract and architecture baseline are in place.
- Core backend/frontend spine is operational.
- Session lifecycle and chat vertical slices are implemented and building.
- Admin shell and readonly telemetry baseline are now implemented.
- Notes vertical slice is now operational with persisted CRUD + visibility controls.
- Presence/rooms vertical slice now includes mounted APIs, Redis-first state, DB snapshot recovery, frontend indicators, and transition notifications; final hardening/e2e remains.
- Audio/livekit vertical slice remains scaffolded pending token/control lifecycle implementation.

Latest verification:

- Monorepo build passes (`backend`, `frontend`, `admin`).
- Backend tests pass for chat system-message protections, notes visibility transitions, notes websocket propagation, campaign/users API coverage, and room recovery/transition sequencing integration coverage.

---

## 2) Stage-by-Stage Progress

### Stage 0: Contract Lock

Status: **Complete**

Goal:

- Define and freeze event names, payload schemas, and permission checks.

Completed:

- Shared package contracts established under `shared/`.
- Core event envelope, validators, permission matrix, and error model implemented.
- Documentation alignment pass completed, with compatibility notes added where conceptual docs differ from runtime contracts.

Exit criteria:

- Shared contract package is canonical and consumed by backend/frontend.

---

### Stage 1: Backend Foundation

Status: **Complete**

Goal:

- Minimal REST and WebSocket handshake contracts.

Completed:

- Backend bootstrap and middleware stack active.
- Health/auth/session baseline endpoints in place.
- WebSocket manager with auth handshake and dispatcher pipeline.
- Baseline hardening applied (security headers, CORS, rate limits, request IDs).

Exit criteria:

- Deterministic error model and baseline transport contracts operational.

---

### Stage 2: Frontend Transport Spine

Status: **Complete**

Goal:

- UI -> Event -> Reducer -> Store -> UI pipeline running end-to-end.

Completed:

- WebSocket client and dispatcher flow operational.
- Zustand root store and domain slices wired.
- App-level auth/session bootstrap path connected.

Exit criteria:

- Frontend transport and state flow proven with live event handling.

---

### Stage 3: Session Lifecycle Vertical Slice

Status: **Complete**

Goal:

- Role-aware session transitions: `IDLE -> ACTIVE -> PAUSED -> ENDED`.

Completed:

- DM-only session mutation enforcement on backend routes.
- Session list hydration and lifecycle controls on frontend.
- Session state transitions with role-gated controls.

Exit criteria:

- End-to-end session lifecycle flow validated for DM/player/spectator views.

---

### Stage 4: Chat Vertical Slice

Status: **Complete**

Goal:

- IC/OOC/public messaging and whispers with strict visibility filtering.

Completed:

- Chat REST endpoints for send/edit/delete/history.
- Prisma-backed chat service with whisper visibility filtering and soft-delete/edit support.
- Session boundary system messages (started/paused/resumed/ended) are persisted and broadcast.
- System messages are immutable (not editable/deletable).
- WS broadcast support with optional recipient filtering.
- Frontend chat window/input/list wired to backend telemetry and event flow.
- Frontend WS client now supports backend wrapper messages (`WS:EVENT`, `WS:CONNECTED`, `WS:ACK`, `WS:ERROR`).
- Frontend whisper flow supports recipient targeting via `recipientId`.

Notes:

- Current implementation is complete for privacy-safe chat behavior and transport compatibility.
- Advanced UX and moderation enhancements may be added in later polish passes.

Exit criteria:

- Room-safe public chat + whisper privacy behavior operational.

---

### Stage 5: Notes Vertical Slice

Status: **Complete**

Goal:

- Private notes, then shared/DM notes with role-filtered selectors.

Completed:

- Notes CRUD routes are implemented and mounted.
- Notes visibility model is enforced (DM_ONLY, PLAYERS_VISIBLE, CUSTOM).
- Notes publish-to-chat flow is implemented.
- Frontend notes panel/card UX is implemented and connected to APIs/store.
- Notes custom-share UX now supports session-user selection with username labels (manual ID fallback retained).
- Notes persistence is backed by Prisma repository/service layers.
- Notes visibility transition tests are in place.
- Notes route-level websocket propagation tests are in place for create/publish flows.
- Notes publish actions are logged for admin telemetry/audit workflows.

Exit criteria:

- Privacy model validated for note ownership and visibility transitions.
- Persisted notes flow is productionized with websocket propagation coverage and publish audit hooks.

---

### Stage 6: Presence and Rooms

Status: **In progress (backend core implemented)**

Goal:

- Presence state machine and room membership transitions.

Completed so far:

- Rooms and presence APIs are implemented and mounted (`/api/rooms`, `/api/presence`).
- Redis-first realtime presence state is implemented for room membership and activity updates.
- Presence persistence is implemented via Prisma `PresenceSnapshot` records.
- Redis failure recovery path now restores session presence from DB snapshots when realtime state is empty.
- WebSocket lifecycle now marks users online/offline and persists periodic presence snapshots.
- Room and presence schema/repository/service layers are implemented (no longer placeholders).
- Session state transitions now orchestrate bulk room membership semantics for session members (ACTIVE -> Main Room, PAUSED/ENDED -> Green Room) with presence state alignment.
- Explicit websocket transition events are broadcast for bulk session-room moves (`ROOM:SESSION_TRANSITION_APPLIED`).
- Frontend room/presence store now hydrates from APIs on connect/reconnect and applies room/presence websocket updates.
- Frontend presence-and-rooms indicators are implemented with live member presence states.
- Frontend transition notification banner/toast is implemented with subtle enter/exit animation and stable layout slot.
- Integration tests now cover Redis-empty snapshot recovery and repeated transition sequencing behavior.

Remaining scope:

- Broader multi-client e2e/load coverage for reconnect/recovery and transition fanout behavior.
- Operational migration rollout and backfill strategy for new room/presence tables.

Exit criteria:

- Reliable session/room scoped state synchronization and reconnection behavior.

---

### Stage 7: Audio and LiveKit Integration

Status: **Scaffolded (not implemented)**

Goal:

- Token flow, room connect/disconnect, controlled audio states and DM overrides.

Completed so far:

- Audio event types are registered in backend/frontend WS dispatcher flows.
- Audio and LiveKit hook/service files exist as staged placeholders.
- Environment configuration keys exist for LiveKit integration.

Remaining scope:

- LiveKit token issuance and client lifecycle integration.
- Room-scoped audio controls and DM override behaviors.
- Frontend audio engine alignment with role constraints.
- Replace placeholder audio/livekit modules with functional token, transport, and control flows.

Exit criteria:

- Stable audio baseline without advanced effects dependency.

---

### Stage 8: Admin and Ops Layer

Status: **In progress (partial completion)**

Goal:

- Admin auth, readonly telemetry first, then controlled moderation actions.

Completed so far:

- Admin SPA redesigned to a full-window, two-column, theme-aware shell.
- Admin sections scaffolded: Dashboard, Users, Rooms & Campaigns, System Health, Logs & Activity, Settings.
- Backend telemetry endpoints implemented:
  - `/api/admin/telemetry/dashboard`
  - `/api/admin/telemetry/status`
  - `/api/admin/telemetry/logs`
- Logs endpoint now supports server-side filtering, pagination, and sorting.
- Admin logs table wired to server-side pagination and sorting.

Remaining scope:

- Production-grade admin authentication and authorization guardrails.
- Moderation actions with audit trail (suspend/force logout/etc).
- Persistent telemetry sources (currently in-memory/baseline metrics in parts).
- Detail panels replacing placeholder actions (for example log entry expand UX).

Exit criteria:

- Authenticated admin workflows with readonly telemetry and controlled actions, fully auditable.

---

## 3) Current Priority Queue

Priority 1:

- Complete Stage 8 security closure: admin auth + role-gated ops actions + audit logging UX.

Priority 2:

- Stage 6 presence/rooms hardening: multi-client e2e/load validation + rollout strategy.

Priority 3:

- Stage 7 audio/livekit token + control lifecycle integration.

---

## 4) Risks and Dependencies

Key risks:

- Admin telemetry currently mixes real signals with baseline placeholders in some metrics.
- In-memory admin log history and WS recovery state are not durable across process restarts.
- Contract-vs-concept terminology drift in docs must continue to be managed carefully.
- Custom-share recipient UX depends on session membership hydration (users appear after joining session).
- Prisma schema is updated, but migration history is not yet committed; DB rollout consistency risk remains.

Dependencies before later stages:

- Stage 6 depends on authoritative presence state model and reconnection strategy.
- Stage 7 depends on stable room/presence semantics and token lifecycle reliability.
